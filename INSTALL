Installation Instructions
=========================

Step 0. Install litecoind
	NOTE: Litecoind currently only supports getblocktemplate version 1. This code was changed to support version 1.
	Set it up and start it!
	Downloading the blockchain can take a few hours to a couple days!

Step 1. Install the stratum core
	git pull https://github.com/slush0/stratum.git
	sudo easy_install stratum
	  (or if using alternate python: sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install stratum)

Step 2. Pull a copy of the miner
	git pull https://github.com/moopless/stratum-mining-litecoin.git

Step 3. Configure the Miner
	cp conf/config_sample.py conf/config.py
	make your changes to conf/config.py 
	Make sure you set the values in BASIC SETTINGS! These are how to connect to litecoind
	  and where your money goes!

Step 4. Run the pool
	twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -
	OR - using alternate python
	/usr/local/bin/twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -

You can now set the URL on your stratum proxy (or miner that supports stratum) to:
http://YOURHOSTNAME:3333

Database Setup
=========================
Table Creation: Tables are auto-created if they don't exist (I will be adding a schema file later)

None:
Well, this doesn't do anything, so there is nothing to set up

Sqlite:
THIS IS THE DEFAULT!
Just set the file path in the config file (or keep the default.)
Support for sqlite3 is built into recent python versions.
A couple notes for Sqlite:
	- Sqlite and threading/concurancy just doesn't work right for that reason it is disabled.
	- Since threading is disabled, The server will "pause" when archiving happens, this will affect
		your miners. However this will not happen often (24 hours after finding a share)

Postgresql:
1. Set up your parameters in the config file.
2. Install the postgresql libraries in your os:
	Redhat and the like:
		yum install postgresql-libs postgresql-devel
	Ubuntu and the like:
		apt-get install postgresql postgresql-devel
3. Install the python bindings
	easy_install psycopg2

Mysql:
1. Set up your parameters in the config file.
2. Install the mysql libraries in your os:
	Redhat and the like:
		yum install mysql mysql-devel
	Ubuntu and the like:
		apt-get install mysql mysql-devel
3. Install the python bindings
	easy_install mysql-python
4. Create a database and user.

Problems????
=========================

Is your firewall off?
Is litecoin running?

TODO: are there other problems?
