Installation Instructions
=========================

Step 0: Install bitcoind
	It MUST be a recent version of bitcoind that support getblocktemplate
	Set it up and start it!
	Downloading the blockchain can take a few hours to a couple days!

Step 1: Install the stratum core
	git pull https://github.com/slush0/stratum.git
	sudo easy_install stratum
	  (or if using alternate python: sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install stratum)

Step 2: Pull a copy of the miner
	git pull https://github.com/generalfault/stratum-mining.git

Step 3: Configure the Miner
	cp conf/config_sample.py conf/config.py
	make your changes to conf/config.py 
	Make sure you set the values in BASIC SETTINGS! These are how to connect to bitcoind
	  and where your money goes!

Step 4: Run the pool
	twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -
	OR - using alternate python
	/usr/local/bin/twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -

You can now set the URL on your stratum proxy (or miner that supports stratum) to:
http://YOURHOSTNAME:3333

Bitcoind blocknotify Setup
=========================
Although scary (for me), this is actually pretty easy.

Step 1: Set Admin Password
	Ensure that you have set the ADMIN_PASSWORD_SHA256 parameter in conf/config.py
	To make life easy you can run the generateAdminHash script to make the hash
		./scripts/generateAdminHash.sh <password>

Step 2: Test It
	Restart the pool if it's already running
	run ./scripts/blocknotify.sh --password <password> --host localhost --port 3333
	Ensure everything is ok.

Step 3: Run bitcoind with blocknotify
	Stop bitcoind if it's already running
	bitcoind stop
	Wait till it ends
	bitcoind -blocknotify="/absolute/path/to/scripts/blocknotify.sh --password <password> --host localhost --port 3333"

Step 4: Adjust pool polling
	Now you should be able to watch the pools debug messages for awhile and see the blocknotify come in
	once you are sure it's working edit conf/config.py and set
		PREVHASH_REFRESH_INTERVAL = to the same value as MERKLE_REFRESH_INTERVAL
	restart the pool

Database Setup
=========================
Table Creation: Tables are auto-created if they don't exist

None:
Well, this doesn't do anything, so there is nothing to set up

Sqlite:
THIS IS THE DEFAULT!
Just set the file path in the config file (or keep the default.)
Support for sqlite3 is built into recent python versions.
A couple notes for Sqlite:
	- Sqlite and threading/concurancy just doesn't work right for that reason it is disabled.
	- Since threading is disabled, The server will "pause" when archiving happens, this will affect
		your miners. However this will not happen often (24 hours after finding a share)

Postgresql:
1: Set up your parameters in the config file.
2: Install the postgresql libraries in your os:
	Redhat and the like:
		yum install postgresql-libs postgresql-devel
	Ubuntu and the like:
		apt-get install postgresql postgresql-devel
3: Install the python bindings
	easy_install psycopg2

Mysql:
1: Set up your parameters in the config file.
2: Install the postgresql libraries in your os:
	Redhat and the like:
		yum install mysql mysql-devel
	Ubuntu and the like:
		apt-get install mysql mysql-devel
3: Install the python bindings
	easy_install mysql-python

Problems????
=========================

Is your firewall off?
Is bitcoind running?

TODO: are there other problems?
