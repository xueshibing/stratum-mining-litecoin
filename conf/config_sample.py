'''
This is example configuration for Stratum server.
Please rename it to config.py and fill correct values.

This is already setup with sane values for solomining.
You NEED to set the parameters in BASIC SETTINGS

# ******************** BASIC SETTINGS ***************
# These are the MUST BE SET parameters!

# ******************** TRANSPORTS *********************

# Hostname or external IP to expose
HOSTNAME = 'localhost'

# Salt used when hashing passwords
PASSWORD_SALT = 'some_crazy_string'

# ******************** Database  *********************

DATABASE_DRIVER = 'sqlite'	# Options: none, sqlite, postgresql or mysql

#  Don't change these unless you know what you are doing

# ******************** Pool Settings *********************

# User Auth Options

# Bitcoind communication polling settings (In Seconds)
PREVHASH_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 5 	# How often to check for new Blocks
				#	If using the blocknotify script (recommended) set = to MERKLE_REFRESH_INTERVAL
				#	(No reason to poll if we're getting pushed notifications)
MERKLE_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 60	# How often check memorypool
				#	This effectively resets the template and incorporates new transactions.
				#	This should be "slow"

INSTANCE_ID = 31		# Not a clue what this is for... :P

# ******************** Pool Difficulty Settings *********************
#  Again, Don't change unless you know what this is for.

# Pool Target (Base Difficulty)

# ******************** Stats Settings *********************

				#   (Requires advanced database to be enabled)
				#	Human : http://<hostname>:<BASIC_STATS_PORT>/
				#	JSON  : http://<hostname>:<BASIC_STATS_PORT>/stats
				#   (Disable if you have your own frontend)

BASIC_STATS_PORT = 8889		# Port to listen on

# ******************** Getwork Proxy Settings *********************
# This enables a copy of slush's getwork proxy for old clients
# It will also auto-redirect new clients to the stratum interface
# so you can point ALL clients to: http://<yourserver>:<GW_PORT>

GW_ENABLE = False		# Enable the Proxy (If enabled you MUST run update_submodules)
GW_PORT = 8331			# Getwork Proxy Port
GW_DISABLE_MIDSTATE = False	# Disable midstate's (Faster but breaks some clients)
GW_SEND_REAL_TARGET = False	# Propigate >1 difficulty to Clients (breaks some clients)

# ******************** Archival Settings *********************

ARCHIVE_SHARES = False		# Use share archiving?
ARCHIVE_DELAY = 86400		# Seconds after finding a share to archive all previous shares

# for calculating SHA256 of your preferred password

# If ADMIN_PORT is set, you can issue commands to that port to interact with 
# the system for things such as user management. It's a JSON interface following 
# REST principles, so '/users' returns a list of users, '/users/1' or '/users/username'
# returns a single user. POSTs are done to lists (so /users), PUTs are done to 
# items (so /users/1)
ADMIN_PORT = 8085 #Port for JSON admin commands, None to disable
